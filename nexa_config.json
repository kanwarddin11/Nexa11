        "summary": "The briefing mixes plausible trend-based assertions with specific product and numeric claims that cannot be independently verified from my training cut-off (2024‑06). Broad trends — a shift from hype to deployment, rising interest in agentic systems, and concerns about AI misuse in conflict zones — align with established reporting through 2024. However, discrete claims (Workday 'Agent Builder' product, a global data‑center demand projection of 84 GW by 2028, and a documented 'surge' of AI‑generated deception specifically at frontlines in Ukraine and Sudan) require contemporaneous primary-source confirmation from 2025–2026 reporting or vendor press releases before they can be rated fully credible.",
